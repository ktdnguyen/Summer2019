The suburban public realm II: Eurourbanism,,,,,,, or can offer the diversity of experience of the 'traditional' public realm. A more recent addition to the debate has been 'new urbanism' or 'neotraditionalism', whose proponents have put forth a set of planning guidelines for suburbia by drawing on design principles embodied in the traditional American small town. The essay critically evaluates these guidelines by examining their application in two neotraditional developments and proposes a research agenda to move the debate ahead.$None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Neotraditional planning: A new strategy for building neighborhoods?,Furuseth O.,Land Use Policy,Journal,Jul-97,Neotraditional planning is an increasingly discussed strategy for building neighborhoods in the United States. To its proponents this urban design-based planning model corrects the flaws inherent in the conventional low density suburban planning that has dominated land use in the United States in the post-World War II era. Neotraditional planning proposes to foster neighborliness and community life through the re-creation of idealized small towns from the early twentieth century.

Taming the neighborhood revolution: Planners,,,,,,, while networks of individuals championed a revival of rail transit. At decade's end, regional leaders rejected two interstate freeways, repudiated a freeway-based regional transportation plan, and agreed to build the beginning of a regional rail system. In seeming contradiction to their anti-auto actions, they also lobbied Congress to change federal law so that they could spend money from deleted interstate highway projects on noninterstate roads rather than on transit. This article documents how planners and power brokers in Portland negotiated among themselves to channel the energy from what began as a citizen- and neighborhood-based revolution into the beginnings of a new consensus about transit, road, and land use development by the end of the decade, one that implicitly recognized personal preference for mass mobility but that explicitly championed designs of transportation facilities to reflect local objectives. ﾂｩ 2007, Sage Publications.

"City building and the rhetoric of ""readability"": Architectural debates in the new Berlin",Murray G.,City and Community,Journal,Mar-08,Berlin represents an unusual case vis-ﾃ-vis the international architectural debate about rebuilding cities. The debate generally takes place between neotraditionalists on the one hand and various avant-gardists on the other. But in Berlin,, a closer look at their rhetoric reveals deeper-lying affinities with the cultural conservatism characteristic of New Urbanism: the image of the city that they favor for Berlin is one of clarity, order, permanence, weightiness, etc. - a surprising image," given the city's troubled past. I examine the Architektenstreit (""Architects' Debate"") that arose among planners", architects, critics, and others concerning the rebuilding of the central city in Berlin after reunification, and I discuss, in particular, the doctrine of critical reconstruction that has come to dominate this debate. I locate the origins of critical reconstruction's peculiar rhetoric in a longing for stability amidst the perceived flux of modernity. More generally, I argue (contra many commentators on the Architektenstreit) that a debate on the representations and images of the city is not merely a distraction from, but rather an essential element in, the politics of the city. ﾂｩ 2008 American Sociological Association.$None,,,,

Your language or ours? Inclusion and exclusion of non-indigenous majorities in Mﾄ・ori and Sﾃ｡mi language revitalization policy,Albury N.,Current Issues in Language Planning,Journal,3-Jul-15,ﾂｩ 2014 Taylor  &  Francis. Since the second half of the twentieth century,, that neither has resulted in greater language revitalization and that both countries, and especially New Zealand, have flirted with a shift on the ideological continuum. Nonetheless, it appears that New Zealand's biculturalist approach has normalized the indigenous language to the extent its revitalization enjoys more support from the non-indigenous polity than in neotraditionalist Norway, where Sﾃ｡mi languages and policy are territorialized and invisible to most Norwegians.$biculturalist policy | Mﾄ・ori | neotraditionalist policy | new speakers | Sﾃ｡mi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two thematic manifestations of neotribal capitalism in the United States,Rose S.,Anthropological Theory,Journal,15-Jun-15,ﾂｩ The Author(s) 2015. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how Elizabeth Rata's (2000) concept of neotribal capitalism can be used to better understand and illuminate the nature and practices of contemporary indigenous governments in the United States. The focus is especially on the workings of neotraditionalist ideology: how it conceals and depoliticizes the class relations at the heart of neotribal society; how this ideology serves to insulate these neotribes from criticism; and how it serves to promote capital accumulation. This is done through an examination of two thematic groupings of relevant issues in contemporary indigenous and scholarly discourses: the interconnected and interrelated issues around labor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article identifies three main trends in Western historiography in English on Stalinism. The totalitarian model dominated research in this field after WWII,, two opposing views within the revisionist approach-the Chicago School (neotraditionalists) and the Columbia School (modernists)- have emerged. Advocates of these approaches of these schools differ over the extent to which the term modernity should be applied to the study of society and the Soviet Union under Stalinism.$Modernity | Neotraditionalism | Revisionism | Social history | Soviet historiography | Stalinism | Totalitarian model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Roles of metalepses in post-symbolist novels,Zhilicheva G.,Vestnik Tomskogo Gosudarstvennogo Universiteta,,,,, the intrigue of a post-symbolist work is centered around not only the lives of the characters but also the 'event of narration' and, in particular, interactions between the narrators. Such interactions can be studied via the analysis of metalepsis due to it being one of the most popular narratological categories describing the system of narrative levels. The research is based on the novels by Valentin Kataev, Konstantin Vaginov, and Boris Pasternak, which belong to different paradigms of literariness (socialist realism, avant-gardism and neotraditionalism). Authorial intrusions of the novels, which belong to avant-garde aesthetics, fulfill the ・・natural・・ role (as described by Genette) of representing the game nature of the discourse. Socialist-realistic novels tend to include dialogues between the reader and the narrator as part of regulation of the narrated world. Here, authorial intrusions do not manifest the freedom of imagination, instead showing self-debasement in the face of the world order. In neotraditionalistic novels, authorial intrusions are the signs of a convergent nature of the narrative. These novels feature ・・double focalisation・・, a form of interaction between the narrator and the protagonist where they are no longer on the different sides of the dialogue but rather merge into a united narrative voice, a supernarrator. The article concludes with a statement that the semantic potential of a metalepsis (Ivanov and the self-esteeming narration, Kataev and the disappearing authorial ・・I・・, Pasternak and the convergence of the author's and the protagonist's consciousness) depends on the chosen narrative strategy (configuration of subject, object and addressee of discourse). Metalepsis is described as a strong way of representing the narrator's actions. It indexes the three main communicative models of post-symbolist fiction: ・・provocation・・, ・・agitation・・, ・・revelation・・.$Boris Pasternak | Metalepsis | Narrative | Narrative strategy | Valentin Kataev | Vsevolod Ivanov

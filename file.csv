'Fundamentalism' Christian and Islamic$Shepard W.$Religion$Journal$October 1987$This article seeks to answer the question whether the term 'fundamentalism' is an appropriate label for certain Islamic movements by undertaking a detailed comparison with Protestant Christian fundamentalism, for which the term was originally coined. After an effort to identify and characterize the two phenomena, a number of similarities and differences are discussed. Among the differences is the fact that the most obvious defining characteristics in each case (Biblical inerrancy for Protestants and politicalsocial involvement for Muslims) are of little relevance to the other case. Among the similarities is a common opposition to 'modernism' and a tendency to stress what has been distinctive to the Protestant and Islamic traditions, respectively. The conclusion is that, while the two phenomena do have much in common, 'fundamentalism' is not an appropriate common label. The author prefers 'Islamic radicalism' for the Muslim case and tentatively suggests 'radical neotraditionalism' as a common label. © 1987.$None
Neotraditional towns and urban villages: the cultural production of a geography of "otherness'$Till K.$Environment &amp; Planning D: Society &amp; Space$Journal$1993$The "neotraditional' planning movement in the US is criticized through an analysis of promotional materials for the urban villages of Rancho Santa Margarita in Orange County, CA. The "traditions' of towns and villages are viewed as recent "inventions' created by corporate planners. Yet the identities constructed for neotraditional towns and urban villages make sense only in relation to the "other'. In southern Orange County, corporate planners present their master-planned communties as "distant' from the suburbs and cities located in Los Angeles and in northern Orange County according to a scale of temporal, geographic, and social values. Implicit to neotraditionalism is a geography of otherness. -from Author$None
Neotraditional developments: The anatomy of a new Urban form$McCann E.$Urban Geography$Journal$April-May 1995$Built at a small scale and incorporating many features of certain old-city neighborhoods, such as narrow streets and small setbacks, neotraditional developments have been designed by architects and built by a small number of developers on suburban greenfield sites since the early 1980s. The distinctive neotraditional urban form represents the convergence of certain aspects of two planning traditions—urban aesthetics and social utopianism. In this paper I outline the two traditions and show how they have been selectively appropriated by neotraditional architects and planners. I suggest that the recent restructuring and fragmentation in the suburban housing market has led to the creation of niche markets, such as the market for neotraditionalism. Using Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus, I argue that the commercial success of neotraditional developments can be explained when recognition is given to the role of relatively affluent house buyers intent on creating a habitus and appropriating symbolic capital. Habitus is defined as the system of values, dispositions, and practices that constitute and are constituted by a societal group. © 1995 by V H. Winston & Son, Inc.$None
A theoretical assessment of the 'neotraditional' settlement form by dimensions of performance$Banai R.$Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design$Journal$March 1996$The 'neotraditional' town is receiving increasing popular, professional, and scholarly attention. Its proponents argue that its design features provide a viable alternative to the modern city and its sprawling suburbs. That critical and normative argument is assessed in this paper by means of Lynch's A Theory of Good City Form and the five performance dimensions given therein. The theory aids in synthesizing otherwise disparate elements of the neotraditional discourse, while subjecting it to a comprehensive and normative critique. The paper is concluded with an assessment of the neotraditional town design in deference to the performance dimensions.$None
The hidden histories and geographies of neotraditional town planning: The case of Seaside, Florida$Falconer Al-Hindi K.$Environment and Planning D: Society and Space$Journal$June 1997$The neotraditional resort development of Seaside, Florida merits special attention from geographers and urban planners because of the normative claims made by its designers and because it has garnered widespread attention from practising architects, planners, and social critics. Under the banners of 'neotraditionalism' and 'community planning' the principles implemented in Seaside have also been employed in numerous other developments in North America. Central to Seaside's appeal and normative content is the deliberate attempt to resurrect an idealised past of uniquely American communitarianism through the skillful manipulation of urban form. We develop our critique of neotraditionalism through a deconstructive analysis of the physical and ideological spaces of Seaside. Specifically, we discuss the origin and development of Seaside, the centrality of its urban and architectural codes, the paradoxical deployment of public and private spaces, and the emergence of a distinctively neotraditional subject. Our basic claim is that neotraditionalism is actually a carefully veiled form of what Foster has called "postmodernism of reaction".$None
The suburban public realm II: Eurourbanism, new urbanism and the implications for urban design in the American metropolis$Southworth M.$Journal of Urban Design$Journal$1997$While the first part of this two-part essay portrayed the bleakness of the suburban public realm in the US, the debate over how physical planning can contribute to making it more vibrant is the subject of this second part. Eurourbanism, or the practice of looking to European cities for a design paradigm, has been criticized on the grounds that the US has its own distinct public realm which is either non-spatial in character or is located in 'non-traditional' public spaces, such as shopping malls, in contrast with the more 'traditional' European sites such as streets and squares. But three are questions about whether the distinctive 'American public realm' is as democratic, or can offer the diversity of experience of the 'traditional' public realm. A more recent addition to the debate has been 'new urbanism' or 'neotraditionalism', whose proponents have put forth a set of planning guidelines for suburbia by drawing on design principles embodied in the traditional American small town. The essay critically evaluates these guidelines by examining their application in two neotraditional developments and proposes a research agenda to move the debate ahead.$None
Neotraditional planning: A new strategy for building neighborhoods?$Furuseth O.$Land Use Policy$Journal$July 1997$Neotraditional planning is an increasingly discussed strategy for building neighborhoods in the United States. To its proponents this urban design-based planning model corrects the flaws inherent in the conventional low density suburban planning that has dominated land use in the United States in the post-World War II era. Neotraditional planning proposes to foster neighborliness and community life through the re-creation of idealized small towns from the early twentieth century. Borrowing design and site planning standards, pedestrianism is encouraged and automobile travel discouraged. This paper presents an assessment of the neotraditional planning model and its effectiveness in creating functioning neighborhoods. The analysis finds serious deficiencies with the community building capacity of this planning paradigm. The progressive rhetoric of neotraditionalism does not match empirical application of the approach. Reasons for this failure are presented. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.$Neighborhood planning | Neotraditional planning | New urbanism | Suburban sprawl
Neotraditionalism in the suburban landscape: Cultural geographies of exclusion in vancouver, canada$Dowling R.$Urban Geography$Journal$1 February 1998$During the 1990s, urban geographers have become fascinated with what are termed “neotraditional landscapes,” yet have ignored the broader cultural contexts of neotraditionalism. In this paper, I use a more encompassing and culturally based conception of neotraditionalism to demonstrate a salience of neotraditionalism in the suburban landscape beyond strict neotraditional developments. My argument is that neotraditionalist beliefs are transforming “ordinary” suburban landscapes in subtle but distinctive ways beyond the presence of neotraditional developments. This different reading of suburban neotraditionalism is filtered through qualitative material collected during in-depth interviews in two suburban neighborhoods in Vancouver, Canada. Though the research is suggestive rather than definitive, I suggest that it has important implications for rethinking geographies of suburban exclusion. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The transformation of ideology and policy: China's leadership in search of a new legitimacy of power$Klaschka S.$Asien Afrika Lateinamerika$Journal$2000$The article examines current developments in the fields of ideology and politics in the People's Republic of China. The focal point is the spread of a new nationalism and the shaping of a neotraditionalism which can currently be observed in China. The first part of the article describes the way in which nationalist tendencies and neotraditionalist positions are expressed in propaganda and policy, in the economy, in the cultural sphere and in the public opinion of the People's Republic. The second part of the study explains - against the background of the general political and economic situation of China - the goals that the Chinese leadership pursues by emphasizing the new elements. The last section of the article shows which of the goals have been reached until now, and explains the meaning of the described developments for China and for the West.$Asian crisis | Cultural conflicts | Ideology | Nationalism | People's Republic of China | Traditionalism
Rethinking biculturalism$Rata E.$Anthropological Theory$Journal$2005$Biculturalism is New Zealand's experience of the shift from class to identity politics and multiculturalism that has characterized a number of liberal democracies since the 1970s. Originally a progressive project committed to incorporating Maori culture into the nation's symbolic identity, biculturalism became the vehicle for separatist ethnic politics and a fundamentalist 'blood and soil' ideology under the control of an emergent neotribal elite. This article traces the shifts in biculturalism and its damaging effects on the conditions required for democracy. It argues that national identity within a universalist concept of humanity, rather than a localized and essentialized ethnic identity, is more likely to ensure the maintenance of the nation-state within the global community.

On World Politics: R.G. Collingwood, Michael Oakeshott and Neotraditionalism in International Relations$Astrov A.$On World Politics: R.G. Collingwood, Michael Oakeshott and Neotraditionalism in International Relations$Book$11 August 2005$© Alexander Astrov 2005. All rights reserved. This book outlines an idea of world politics as an activity of thinking and speaking about the conditions of world order. World order is understood not as an arrangement of entities but a complex of variously situated activities conducted by individuals as members of diverse associations of their own. Within contemporary International Relations it entails a theoretical position, neotraditionalism, as a reformulation of the initial 'traditionalist' approach in the wake of rationalism and subsequent reflectivist critique.$None

Taming the neighborhood revolution: Planners, power brokers, and the birth of neotraditionalism in portland, oregon$Thompson G.$Journal of Planning History$Journal$August 2007$In the early 1970s, neighborhood-based movements arose in Portland, Oregon, against freeways, while networks of individuals championed a revival of rail transit. At decade's end, regional leaders rejected two interstate freeways, repudiated a freeway-based regional transportation plan, and agreed to build the beginning of a regional rail system. In seeming contradiction to their anti-auto actions, they also lobbied Congress to change federal law so that they could spend money from deleted interstate highway projects on noninterstate roads rather than on transit. This article documents how planners and power brokers in Portland negotiated among themselves to channel the energy from what began as a citizen- and neighborhood-based revolution into the beginnings of a new consensus about transit, road, and land use development by the end of the decade, one that implicitly recognized personal preference for mass mobility but that explicitly championed designs of transportation facilities to reflect local objectives. © 2007, Sage Publications.

City building and the rhetoric of "readability": Architectural debates in the new Berlin$Murray G.$City and Community$Journal$March 2008$Berlin represents an unusual case vis-à-vis the international architectural debate about rebuilding cities. The debate generally takes place between neotraditionalists on the one hand and various avant-gardists on the other. But in Berlin, the main representatives of the first camp are not, for once, members of the New Urbanism movement, nor are they neotraditionalists tout court; they are, at least on their own self-understanding, pioneers of a kind of 'Third Way' between the two extremes of neotraditionalism and avant-gardism. Nevertheless, a closer look at their rhetoric reveals deeper-lying affinities with the cultural conservatism characteristic of New Urbanism: the image of the city that they favor for Berlin is one of clarity, order, permanence, weightiness, etc. - a surprising image, given the city's troubled past. I examine the Architektenstreit ("Architects' Debate") that arose among planners, architects, critics, and others concerning the rebuilding of the central city in Berlin after reunification, and I discuss, in particular, the doctrine of critical reconstruction that has come to dominate this debate. I locate the origins of critical reconstruction's peculiar rhetoric in a longing for stability amidst the perceived flux of modernity. More generally, I argue (contra many commentators on the Architektenstreit) that a debate on the representations and images of the city is not merely a distraction from, but rather an essential element in, the politics of the city. © 2008 American Sociological Association.$None
Family policy in Russia: Folkways versus stateways revisited$Kravchenko Z.$Handbook of Family Policies Across the Globe$Book$1 January 2014$© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014. Family policy in Russia has a long history of juggling with ideas of family autonomy and state intervention. During the Soviet period, the policies were aimed at stimulating fertility and female employment by providing institutional childcare and job protection. By the time the reforms broke through in the 1990s, the country was facing several consequences of the earlier policy design. Double burden of work and care carried by women was accompanied by virtual "crowding out" of men from the family domain. The dramatic turmoil in economic, political, and social life brought a new light on the issue of decreasing fertility and rocketing poverty. In this chapter, we focus on the interplay between several family policy sectors related to these challenges, present the current regulations, highlight their effects, and discuss possible directions for future policy realization.$Dual-earner/female-carer model | Maternity capital | Neotraditionalism | Pronatalism | Russia

Your language or ours? Inclusion and exclusion of non-indigenous majorities in Māori and Sámi language revitalization policy$Albury N.$Current Issues in Language Planning$Journal$3 July 2015$© 2014 Taylor  &  Francis. Since the second half of the twentieth century, post-colonial governments have commonly sought to revitalize the indigenous languages their imperialist predecessors hoped to eradicate. Although the impetus to revitalize is shared, the question of excluding or including the non-indigenous majority in the revitalization process, and encouraging them to become new speakers of the language, is a matter of politics and ideology. This paper draws on neotraditionalism and biculturalism as ideological premises in language revitalization policy to compare and contrast the nature and experiences of government policy in New Zealand and Norway as two such examples. In doing so, the paper sees neotraditionalism and biculturalism as ends of an ideological continuum that can plot policy frameworks and their changes. It finds, however, that neither has resulted in greater language revitalization and that both countries, and especially New Zealand, have flirted with a shift on the ideological continuum. Nonetheless, it appears that New Zealand's biculturalist approach has normalized the indigenous language to the extent its revitalization enjoys more support from the non-indigenous polity than in neotraditionalist Norway, where Sámi languages and policy are territorialized and invisible to most Norwegians.$biculturalist policy | Māori | neotraditionalist policy | new speakers | Sámi
Two thematic manifestations of neotribal capitalism in the United States$Rose S.$Anthropological Theory$Journal$15 June 2015$© The Author(s) 2015. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how Elizabeth Rata's (2000) concept of neotribal capitalism can be used to better understand and illuminate the nature and practices of contemporary indigenous governments in the United States. The focus is especially on the workings of neotraditionalist ideology: how it conceals and depoliticizes the class relations at the heart of neotribal society; how this ideology serves to insulate these neotribes from criticism; and how it serves to promote capital accumulation. This is done through an examination of two thematic groupings of relevant issues in contemporary indigenous and scholarly discourses: the interconnected and interrelated issues around labor, class consciousness, and unionization within indigenous communities; and the issues of indigenous identity, tribal citizenship, and the politics around the movement for disenrollment.$Identity | indigenous | labor | Native American | neotraditionalism | neotribal capitalism | United States
Customizations of law: Courts of elders (Aksakal Courts) in rural and urban kyrgyzstan$Beyer J.$Political and Legal Anthropology Review$Journal$1 May 2015$© 2015 by the American Anthropological Association. This article deals with a neotraditional institution: the aksakal courts (courts of elders, or "whitebeards") in Central Asian Kyrgyzstan. Founded in 1993 by the first president of the country, and based on an elaborate law enacted in 2002, the newly appointed aksakal judges were supposed to judge according to what were considered to be the customs and traditions of the Kyrgyz. In this article I show in what ways the judges' way of "being aksakals" often accords neither with the letter nor intent of the law, but reflects a more fundamental way of ordering the world, here referred to as customization. I argue that the ways in which the court members in rural and urban Kyrgyzstan link themselves to traditionalist imagery and state trappings reveal a more general point about how people in contemporary Central Asia engage with their being-in-the-world. This is particularly relevant in times of social change such as those initiated after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.$Central Asia | Elders | Kyrgyzstan | Law | Neotraditionalism | Ordering | State
La Nota Emilianense e il neotradizionalismo: L'equivoco del «cantar de Rodlane»$Marcenaro S.$Zeitschrift fur Romanische Philologie$Journal$6 September 2018$© 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018. This study focuses on a problem which has been widely debated among specialists in epic literature, Hispanists and Romance Philologists, that is the supposed existence of a Chanson de Geste written in Castilian («Cantar de Rodlane») around 1060-1070. According to Ramón Menéndez Pidal, this text could be the direct source for the famous and anonymous Nota Emilianense. Nevertheless, a thorough analysis of the arguments proposed by Menéndez Pidal leads to the conclusion that the Cantar de Rodlane probably never existed and, on the other hand, that some of the principles of Pidal's neotraditionalist theory should be critically revisited.$Castilian epic literature | neotraditionalism | Nota Emilianense | Ramón Menéndez Pidal
Historiographic debates in English on Stalinism$Resalt A.$Ayer$Journal$2018$© 2018 Marcial Pons Librero. All rights reserved. This article identifies three main trends in Western historiography in English on Stalinism. The totalitarian model dominated research in this field after WWII, according to which political events and individuals were core elements, but the individual was seen as a passive object in the face of political control. This gave way to a revisionist approach of sixties and seventies, which placed individuals in the centre of the historical narrative. Based on the idea of the revolution from below, it placed emphasis on the existence of mass support for social change and for state and party measures. The post-revi-sionism of the 1980s, in turn, incorporated the previously overlooked role of ideology. Presendy, two opposing views within the revisionist approach-the Chicago School (neotraditionalists) and the Columbia School (modernists)- have emerged. Advocates of these approaches of these schools differ over the extent to which the term modernity should be applied to the study of society and the Soviet Union under Stalinism.$Modernity | Neotraditionalism | Revisionism | Social history | Soviet historiography | Stalinism | Totalitarian model
Roles of metalepses in post-symbolist novels$Zhilicheva G.$Vestnik Tomskogo Gosudarstvennogo Universiteta, Filologiya$Journal$2018$© 2018 Tomsk State University. All rights reserved. This article deals with the narrative functions of metalepsis (in Gerard Genette's terms), a device that shows a transgression of the boundaries between the reality of characters and the reality of a narrator. It is devoted to the analysis of the “I-narration” fragments of mostly third-person narrated texts (so-called 'authorial intrusions'). The article suggests that the meanings of those fragments correlate with the concept of personality, worldview and narrative mode manifested in the work. Post-symbolist authors are always in search of new ways to influence their readers. The authorial position becomes a field of experiment (said experiments having various ideological, aesthetic and pragmatic reasons) as a part of a general concept of 'overcoming an aesthetic crisis'. The image of the creator represented in the narrative, relationships between the “I” and the “Other” (in Bakhtin's terms, “one's own words” and “alien words”) appear to be questioned. Therefore, the intrigue of a post-symbolist work is centered around not only the lives of the characters but also the 'event of narration' and, in particular, interactions between the narrators. Such interactions can be studied via the analysis of metalepsis due to it being one of the most popular narratological categories describing the system of narrative levels. The research is based on the novels by Valentin Kataev, Konstantin Vaginov, and Boris Pasternak, which belong to different paradigms of literariness (socialist realism, avant-gardism and neotraditionalism). Authorial intrusions of the novels, which belong to avant-garde aesthetics, fulfill the “natural” role (as described by Genette) of representing the game nature of the discourse. Socialist-realistic novels tend to include dialogues between the reader and the narrator as part of regulation of the narrated world. Here, authorial intrusions do not manifest the freedom of imagination, instead showing self-debasement in the face of the world order. In neotraditionalistic novels, authorial intrusions are the signs of a convergent nature of the narrative. These novels feature “double focalisation”, a form of interaction between the narrator and the protagonist where they are no longer on the different sides of the dialogue but rather merge into a united narrative voice, a supernarrator. The article concludes with a statement that the semantic potential of a metalepsis (Ivanov and the self-esteeming narration, Kataev and the disappearing authorial “I”, Pasternak and the convergence of the author's and the protagonist's consciousness) depends on the chosen narrative strategy (configuration of subject, object and addressee of discourse). Metalepsis is described as a strong way of representing the narrator's actions. It indexes the three main communicative models of post-symbolist fiction: “provocation”, “agitation”, “revelation”.$Boris Pasternak | Metalepsis | Narrative | Narrative strategy | Valentin Kataev | Vsevolod Ivanov
